The raw dataset - 18,445
Split into train : eval/dev : test in 8:1:1 ratio
After dropping uncertain - x


After dropping uncertain, train has 10,836; eval/dev has 1,404; final test set has x

Drop 50% of the train set at the beginning

1. Number of observations

Model:
	Architecture Figure


	Tuning of hyperparameter figures w.r.t (evaluation test is used)
		alpha = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 (fix batch size = 32, drop out = 0.1)
		batch size = 16, 32, 64 (fix alpha from step 1 and drop out = 0.1)
		dropout rate = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 (fix alpha and batch size from steps 1 and 2)

	Result Table 1: dice coefficient on the test Set
								examples of prediction (bad, good, average)

Additional analyses:
  	Fix previous fire mask as the most important feature
		Then, add one feature at a time (in order from Table 5) and report the incremental contribution of each variable

		If adding a feature harms dice coefficient, we will drop that

		Last table will be without those features that harm dice coefficients (Table 3 - compare with Table 1)

 Contribution:
 		Architecture is different
		table 3 analyses
